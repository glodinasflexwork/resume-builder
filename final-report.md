# Resume Builder - Final Report

## Project Overview
The Resume Builder is a comprehensive web application that allows users to create professional resumes with multiple templates and sections. The application is built using Next.js and integrates with a Neon PostgreSQL database for data storage.

## Key Features
- Multiple resume templates (Brussels, Prague, Shanghai)
- Comprehensive resume sections:
  - Personal details
  - Work experience
  - Education
  - Skills
  - Languages
  - References
- PDF export functionality
- User authentication
- Responsive design for all devices

## Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript and responsive components
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes for all CRUD operations
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: Custom user authentication system
- **Deployment**: GitHub repository ready for Vercel deployment

## Technical Challenges Resolved
1. **Next.js 15 Handler Signature Issue**
   - Problem: Incorrect parameter types in API route handlers
   - Solution: Updated all handlers to use Promise-based params
   - Status: ✅ Resolved

2. **Params Usage Issue**
   - Problem: Params were used synchronously instead of being awaited
   - Solution: Updated all handlers to properly await params before accessing properties
   - Status: ✅ Resolved

3. **Prisma Schema/Type Issues**
   - Problem: Type mismatches between Prisma schema and API handlers
   - Solution: Simplified database interactions to avoid schema conflicts
   - Status: ✅ Resolved

## Testing Results
All API endpoints and core functionality have been thoroughly tested and are working correctly:
- Resume creation and retrieval
- Personal details management
- Experience entries
- Education entries
- Skills management
- Languages section
- PDF export functionality
